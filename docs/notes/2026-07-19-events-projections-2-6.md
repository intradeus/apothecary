# Events & projections (§2, §6)

- **Added `run_archived{}` to the event catalog.** §2 lists `archived` as a
  state and §6 requires projections to be rebuildable from events alone, but
  the §6 catalog has no event producing that state — one or the other had to
  give. Empty payload; emitted by the archive API / reaper.
- **Event payloads are pointers by construction**: `EventType()` uses pointer
  receivers so only `*event.X` satisfies `Payload`. Keeps the projection's
  type switch and the codec's registry in agreement.
- **Store carries `Watch`** (replay after seq N, then live) — the SSE
  endpoint (§8 `?after_seq=`) needs it; putting it on the store keeps the
  HTTP layer projection-free.
- **`View.TicketGoal`** is carried in the projection struct (not a §6
  read-model column, excluded from JSON) because crash recovery needs the
  goal to re-assemble prompts without re-reading the whole event log twice.
- Timestamps are stamped by the store (UTC, injectable clock in MemStore);
  seq is assigned by the store, starting at 1 per run.
